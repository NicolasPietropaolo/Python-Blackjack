# Python-Blackjack

Created a text-based Blackjack card game with ASCII text cards. The programs works the same as an actual Blackjack game works with Ace cards having a high or low value of 11 or 1 respectively depending on the player's hand and the player has the abilty to invoke commands including, double down, hit, and stand. Players start with a certain amount of chips and are able to make an initial bet of any amount at the beginning of each hand and they can continue to play until their chips run out. The program contains rudimentary AI in order to simulate the dealer during a given hand where conditions are set to determine when the dealer stops or continues to add cards to their given hand. Only one of the dealer's initial cars is face up with the other being face down so the player is not able to see all the dealers cards.
